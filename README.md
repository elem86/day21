# Day 21

🎯 Day 21 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

📈 Outlier Detection in Excel

Today I built a simple Outlier Detection Tool in Excel to highlight unusually high or low values using Z-scores — all without leaving the spreadsheet!

✅ What I did:

  - Created a synthetic dataset with 200 sales reps and their monthly sales

  - Calculated the mean and standard deviation

  - Used the Z-score formula to standardize each value

  - Applied conditional formatting to highlight:

    - 🔴 High outliers (Z > 2)

    - 🔵 Low outliers (Z < -2)
    

💡 It’s a fast, visual way to flag anomalies for further analysis — and a great building block for real-world reporting dashboards.

🕒 Built in under 1 hour as part of my daily data challenge.
